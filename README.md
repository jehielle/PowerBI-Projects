Power BI projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in data analysis and data visualization.

## Project: AdventureWorksDW Sales Dashboard
Using the [AdventureWorksDW database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms), I created a sales overview dashboard for the fictitious cycling company that includes sales by top 10 products sold, largest product categories sold, profit vs budget, and a map that shows the frequency of sales by city.

## Project: Major Data Breaches (2004-2021) Analysis
Using [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hishaamarmghan/list-of-top-data-breaches-2004-2021), I created a visual analysis of major data breaches from 2004 to 2021 to further examine the trends of how, why, and when such breaches occurred, which also assists in finding preventative measures that could have been taken to ensure the data was secured.
